# Generative AI

Machine Learning Techniques

- Supervised Learning: Models are presented with input data and the desired results. The model will then attempt to learn rules that map the input data to the desired results.

- Unsupervised Learning: Models are presented with datasets that have no labels or predefined patterns, and the model will attempt to infer the underlying structures from the dataset. Generative AI is a type of unsupervised learning.

- Reinforcement learning: The model or agent will interact with a dynamic world to achieve a certain goal. The dynamic world will reward or punish the agent based on its actions. Overtime, the agent will learn to navigate the dynamic world and accomplish its goal(s) based on the rewards and punishments that it has received.
