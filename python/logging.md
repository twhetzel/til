# Logging

## Tips for Log messages
* Be professional and clear
* Be concise and use normal capitalization
* Choose the appropriate level for logging
** DEBUG - use for anything that happens in the program
** ERROR - use to record any error that happens
** INFO - use to record all actions that are user-driven or system specific, such as regularly scheduled operations
* Provide useful information in the log message, e.g. a value or ID where the function encountered an error
